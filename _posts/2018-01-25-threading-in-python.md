title: Threading in Python
---

In January I gave my very first programming talk to a room full of strangers. It
was an awesome experience, and one that I now hope to repeat as much as I can.
It was just a simple presentation at my local [Python
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Artists-of-Arkansas/events/246648649/),
and it turned out to be a really great way for me to practice my presentation
skills, and I got to have some really interesting conversations afterwards that
I probably wouldn't have had otherwise. Putting myself out there was a big first
step, and I hope that this will help me grow as a developer, writer, and
speaker.

The talk was a simple introduction to threading and multiprocessing in Python. I
had decided to go with a topic that I felt I understood well, but I did try to
touch on some other techniques and 3rd party tools at the end. I'm now posting
my slides here so that others may find them and benefit.
