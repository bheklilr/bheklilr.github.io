title: Building Webapps in Tornado
---

After last month I figured it would be a little while until I presented in front
of a group again, but with only a few days until [February's Python
meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Artists-of-Arkansas/events/247191510/) I
was asked to fill in for another member who had a scheduling conflict come up.
As the planned talk was on Flask, I hurriedly put together a presentation on the
web framework I already knew how to use: Tornado.

While Tornado isn't as popular as Flask or Django in Python, I feel like it has
real potential at being a powerful web framework. It doesn't come with as many
bells and whistles as Django, and there aren't as many 3rd party packages as
Flask, Tornado still stands as a powerful, fast, and extensible web framework.
It is a bit more in the enterprise style as well, but it manages to keep itself
pretty simple. I can see how with a handful of targeted extensions Tornado would
be much more powerful as well.

As usual, I am posting my slides here in case anyone can benefit from them. If
you have any questions or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out to me
via any platform that I'm on.
