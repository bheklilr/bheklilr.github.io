title: How I Ended Up Starting a Python Workshop
---

Today's story is one that hopefully will inspire you to put yourself out there.
You never know what opportunities you will come across just by hanging around
the right places and talking to people.

Late last year I decided that I needed to start socializing a bit more with
other developers.  I had noticed that my skills development had stagnated
somewhat, and I was itching to learn something new.  I turned to the popular
site [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and started looking around for what was
available.  Being a Python developer by day, I immediately joined my [local
Python meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Artists-of-Arkansas/) (along with a
few others), and planned to attend at the next meeting.  After attending one
meeting, I was impressed by the quality of the presentation given that evening,
but I noticed that while there were over 300 people in the group on meetup.com,
only about 15 or 20 people had showed up.  The organizer also announced that we
had a lack of people volunteering to give future presentations and put out a
call for participation.

This is what put the thought in my head that maybe this was something _I_ could
do. Really, why not? You don't have to have anything special to be able to give
a talk, just the confidence to get up in front of people. With the start of the
new year, I was signed up to give [my first talk](/2018/01/25/threading-in-python/).

And you know what?  As someone who was awkward in school, always afraid to give
presentations in class, and someone who generally likes to be left alone, _I had
a ton of fun_.  It was nerve wracking, but it introduced me to the entire group
that attended that night, and as a result there were several people who came up
to talk to me afterwards.  Some just wanted to tell me that they enjoyed the
talk and asked for the slides, but with others I had lengthy conversations with
about programming, work, and ambitions.
