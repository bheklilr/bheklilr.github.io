title: About
---

I'm a Python and Haskell developer with an interest in scientific computing, a
passion for abstract math, and a love of early generation game consoles.  My
career has mainly focused on building scientific and engineering applications,
leading me to have written many tools for engineers to process data, generate
reports, and control lab equipment.  I've also developed a number of automated
production systems for quality control that have been deployed around the world.

In my spare time, I have been aspiring to become a regular speaker at
conferences, and I am going to attempt to get into writing blog posts to try to
improve my writing skills.  My ultimate goal is to one day write my own book(s)
on programming.

Offline I enjoy spending time with my wife and our two wonderful children.  They
are the reason why I do what I do, and I feel honored to be able to watch them
grow up.
