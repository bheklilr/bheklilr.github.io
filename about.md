title: About
---

I'm a Python and Haskell developer with an interest in scientific computing, a
passion for abstract math, and a love of early generation game consoles.  My
career has mainly focused on building scientific and engineering applications,
leading me to have written many tools for engineers to process data, generate
reports, and control lab equipment.  I've also developed a number of automated
production systems for quality control that have been deployed around the world.

Data processing with Python is one of strengths, from doing linear algebra and
FFTs with NumPy to creating beautiful and information-dense visualizations with
Pandas as seaborn.  I'm always on the lookout for new techniques and tools for
extracting the maximum amount of information from my data.

Offline I enjoy spending time with my wife and our two wonderful children.  They
are the reason why I do what I do, and I feel honored to be able to watch them
grow up.
